# Yoki (WIP)
Yet another Discord bot.

## What is this?  
This is Yoki, a discord bot that encorporates ideas that I think some discord bots are missing.

## Commands
Coming soon.

## How can I contribute?
Yoki is structured almost like a monorepo, with each module of it (giveaway, logging, etc) in different folders in src/. The structure we are attempting to create is so that only one line has to be changed in the core to add another module. Just extend core/structures/modules.

## Scripts  
`npm start` - Compile the bot and run it.   
`npm run lint` - Lint the TS of the bot    
`npm run build` - Compile the bot
