## About the Project  
Yoki was built out of a desire to cut down the amount of bots that had to be invited to a discord server. It's original purpose was to allow sub-guilds in a guild, but was later repurposed to be a general usage discord bot.

### Built with  
* [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js)  
* [discord-akairo](https://github.com/discord-akairo/discord-akairo)  
* [knex.js](https://github.com/knex/knex)  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Yoki **requires Node.js >=12** due to the dependency on discord.js.  
Yoki **advises you use PNPM** due to it's monorepo setup. You can use npm, but it will be much more of a hassle.

**You must enable the SERVER MEMBERS intent in https://discord.com/developers/applications**

- `git clone https://github.com/zaida04/Yoki.git`  
- `cd yoki`
- `pnpm i --r`  
- Change `knexfile.example.js` => `knexfile.js`  
- supply ENV variables in a `bot.env` file in the root.  
- `pnpm run build`  
- `pnpm run knex:init`
- `pnpm run start:bot` 
    
2. Docker
